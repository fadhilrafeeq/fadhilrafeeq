- 👋 Hello everyone, I’m Fadhil, a final year MSc. Data Science Student based in Bangalore, India. 
- 👀 I’m interested in finding insights from data, experimenting what could happen if i played around with this and that variable, making a neat dashboard to present my insights, Basically describing what an Analyst is, haha!!
- 🌱 I’m currently working on  improving my mathematical skills, analytical thinking, and sharpening my SQL skills.
- 💞️ I’d love to collaborate on Deep Learning & Artificial Intelligence projects, if not working on the main functional, I'd love work with the analysis in hopes of making my co-developers job easier.
